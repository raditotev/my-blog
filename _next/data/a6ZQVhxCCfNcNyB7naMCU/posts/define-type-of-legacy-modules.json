These errors can occur because TypeScript does not know about the types and interfaces of the module, making it difficult to use the module in your code.\n\nIn this post, we'll look at how you can use declaration files to fix these errors and provide TypeScript with the necessary type information.\n\n## What are declaration files?\n\nA declaration file tells TypeScript about the types and interfaces of a module that is not written in TypeScript. By providing this information, TypeScript can properly type-check your code and prevent errors that may occur when using the module.\n\nDeclaration files have the extension `.d.ts` and contain TypeScript type definitions for the module. These files do not contain any executable code, but only provide the necessary type information to the TypeScript compiler.\n\n## Example: fixing an error when importing a module\n\nLet's say you are working on a TypeScript project that uses a module called `sitar-encryption`. This module is not written in TypeScript, but you want to use it in your TypeScript code.\n\nHere's an example of how you might import and use the module:\n\n```ts\nimport axios from 'axios'\nimport sitarEncryption from 'sitar-encryption'\n\nconst api = axios.create({ /** options */ })\n\nconst config = {\n  role: 'client',\n  // add any other properties your config may have\n}\n\nconst sitar = sitarEncryption(config)\nsitar(api)\n```\n\nWhen you try to compile this code with TypeScript, you might encounter an error like this:\n\n```lua\nerror TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'sitar-encryption'.\n\n```\n\nThis error occurs because TypeScript does not know about the types and interfaces of the `sitar-encryption` module.\n\nTo fix this error, we need to create a declaration file for the module.\n\n```ts\ndeclare module 'sitar-encryption' {\n  import { AxiosInstance } from 'axios'\n\n  interface Config {\n    role: 'client' | 'server';\n    // define any other properties your config may have\n  }\n\n  interface Sitar {\n    (axios: AxiosInstance): unknown;\n  }\n\n  function sitarEncryption(config: Config): Sitar;\n  export = sitarEncryption;\n}\n```\n\nThis file defines the `Config` and `Sitar` interfaces, as well as the `sitarEncryption` function. It also exports the sitarEncryption function so that it can be imported by other modules.\n\nSave this file in your project as `sitar-encryption.d.ts`.\n\n## Using the declaration file\n\nNow that we have created the declaration file, we can use it in our TypeScript code to provide TypeScript with the necessary type information.\n\nHere's an example of how we can import and use the `sitar-encryption` module with the declaration file:\n\n```ts\nimport axios from 'axios'\nimport sitarEncryption from 'sitar-encryption'\n\nconst api = axios.create({ /** options */ })\n\nconst config = {\n  role: 'client',\n  // add any other properties your config may have\n}\n\nconst sitar: Sitar = sitarEncryption(config)\nsitar(api)\n```\n\nBy adding the declaration file, we have provided TypeScript with the necessary type information and we can now use the module in our typescript project.\n\n---\n*This post was created with the help of ChatGPT.*"}},"__N_SSG":true}
